question: "What are the judging criteria for project evaluation?"
answer: "The judging criteria typically include factors such as novelty, methodology, innovation, technical implementation, usability, impact, and presentation (report) quality. Each project is evaluated based on these criteria to determine the winners.
Note: The project proposal and final submissions must adhere to the mandates laid by the “IIT Bombay FOSSEE GIS team” at all times. By participating in the “National Level OpenHardware-IoT based Geospatial Hackathon” the teams agree that the decision taken by the ‘Core Organizing Committee’ and/or the ‘IIT Bombay FOSSEE GIS & OSHW’ team(s) shall be final and non-appealable."

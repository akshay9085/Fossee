question: "Can participants use pre-existing IoT devices or hardware prototypes for their projects, or do they need to develop new solutions from scratch?"
answer: "The participants/ participating team(s) are encouraged to develop their solutions/ prototypes from scratch. But, to spread awareness about “OpenSource Hardware-IoT’ and ‘GIS’ technologies in all domains, we encourage the students cutting across domains to give it a try. Hence, we do allow participants to use pre-existing IoT devices or hardware prototypes for their projects, as long as they meet the project requirements and objectives. All designs and code submitted must adhere to the CC-BY-SA license requirements.
Note: The decision of the ‘Core Organizing Committee’ of the National Level OpenHardware-IoT based Geospatial Hackathon, and/or the ‘IIT Bombay FOSSEE GIS & OSHW’ team(s) shall be final and non-appealable, in all circumstances."

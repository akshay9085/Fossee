question: "Can an Indian citizen studying at some foreign university apply for this hackathon?"
answer: "YES! Indian Citizens pursuing their studies abroad can register. They shall get ‘e-certificates’ if they emerge as winners, but they (Indian students studying in foreign universities) won't be eligible for cash awards as transferring honoraria outside India is not allowed as per the policy laid by the funding agency/ prize sponsor."

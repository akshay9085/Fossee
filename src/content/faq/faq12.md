question: "How will the hackathon support participants who may be new to IoT or geospatial technologies and require additional guidance or resources?"
answer: "The ‘Core Organizing Committee’ of the National Level OpenHardware-Iot based Geospatial Hackathon will conduct ‘focused’ workshops, mentoring sessions, orientation (state-wise), online resources such as the award-winning ‘SpokenTutorial’ on relevant technologies, etc.
Note: The main emphasis here is to ensure that the resources deployed work as a support system for participants to learn and enhance their (IoT, and GIS) skills throughout the event."

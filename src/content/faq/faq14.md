question: "Can participants submit multiple projects, and if so, are there any limitations on the number of submissions per team?"
answer: "YES! But make sure you the team leader is not the same person. There is ‘NO’ lamination on the number of teams.
Note: Institutions fielding more than (valid) 25 teams can assign a SPOC (Single Point of Contact - SPOC) for obtaining dedicated + direct support from the committee."

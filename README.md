# Converting Static Website to Astro Framework: Documentation

This project aims to convert a static website into the Astro framework, leveraging Astro's modern static site generation capabilities for improved performance, maintainability, and responsiveness.

## Introduction

The provided static website has been converted into the Astro framework, utilizing HTML, CSS (Bootstrap/Tailwind), and Vanilla JavaScript. The conversion process involved refactoring the codebase into reusable Astro components, implementing responsive design principles, and optimizing performance using Astro's features.

## Challenges Faced

Adapting the navbar, accordion, and carousel components for mobile responsiveness proved challenging, as reliance on pre-made templates from Bootstrap and Tailwind was not viable within the Astro framework. Designing these components from scratch required extensive time and effort, especially as I lacked prior experience in creating responsive designs independently.
